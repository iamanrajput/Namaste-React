# Chapter 04 - Talk is Cheap, show me the code

## Q: Is `JSX` mandatory for React?
A: `JSX` is an Extension Syntax that allows writing HTML and Javascript together easily in React and is used to create React elements. So, anything that is done with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript means it is not mandatory to write React code in JSX.

## Q: Is `ES6` mandatory for React?
A: `ES6` is not mandatory for `React` but is highly recommendable. The latest projects created on React rely a lot on ES6. ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6. ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015.

React uses ES6, and you should be familiar with some of the new features like: Classes, Arrow Functions, Variables(let, const).

## Q: How can I write `comments` in JSX?
A: JSX comments are written as follows:
- `{/*  */}` - for single or multiline comments

## Q: What is `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>`?
A: `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` is a feature in React that allows you to return multiple elements from a React component by allowing you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
`<></>` is the shorthand tag for `React.Fragment`. The only difference between them is that the shorthand version does not support the key attribute.
#### Example
```
return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <Header />
            <Navigation />
            <Main />
            <Footer />
        </React.Fragment>
    );
```
Using `<> </>` : 
```
return (
        <>
            <Header />
            <Navigation />
            <Main />
            <Footer />
        </>
    );
```

## Q: What is `React Fiber`?
A: React Fiber is a concept of ReactJS that is used to render a system faster, smoother and smarter.

Fiber is asynchronous

## Q: What is `props in React`? Ways to.
A: props stands for properties. Props are arguments passed into React components. props are used in React to pass data from one component to another (from a parent component to a child component(s)). Whenever we have to pass data dynamically, we use Props.
#### Example
```
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Tool name="Aman Rajput" tool="React"/> // name and tool are props
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Q: Difference between `Virtual DOM` and `Real DOM`?
A: DOM stands for `Document Object Model`, which represents your application UI and whenever the changes are made in the application, this DOM gets updated and the user is able to visualize the changes. 

DOM is an interface that allows scripts to update the content, style, and structure of the document.
- `Virtual DOM`
    - The Virtual DOM is a light-weight abstraction of the DOM. You can think of it as a copy of the DOM, that can be updated without affecting the actual DOM. It has all the same properties as the real DOM object, but doesn‚Äôt have the ability to write to the screen like the real DOM.
    - Virtual DOM is just like a blueprint of a machine, can do the changes in the blueprint but those changes will not directly apply to the machine.
- `Real DOM`
    - It represents the entire UI(User Interface) of the web application as the tree data structure. It is a structural representation of HTML elements of a web application in simple words.

|   `Real DOM`    |   `Virtual DOM` |
|-------------|-----------------|
| DOM manipulation is very expensive  | DOM manipulation is very easy  | 
| There is too much memory wastage  | No memory wastage  |
| It updates Slow | It updates fast |
| It can directly update HTML | It can‚Äôt update HTML directly  |
|  Creates a new DOM if the element updates. | Update the JSX if the element update |
| It allows us to directly target any specific node (HTML element) | It can produce about 200,000 Virtual DOM Nodes / Second. |
| It represents the UI of your application | It is only a virtual representation of the DOM |

## Map Function

The `map()` function creates a new array by calling a function for every element in the array.
