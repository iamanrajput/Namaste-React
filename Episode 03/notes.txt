What is JSX?
JSX-JavaScript XML (XML-Extensible markup language)
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within their JavaScript files. 

It is often used with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create reusable UI components.
Many peope says JSX is HTML in JS but -- 
JSX is not HTML in JS it is a HTML-like syntax.


Earlier people use to write React code like-
const heading = React.createElement(
    "h1",
    {id: "heading"},
    "Namaste React ðŸš€"
);

But then coms jsx syntax-
const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">Namaste React using JSXðŸš€</h1>;

Both code works same.So,people prefer jsx.

JS engine understand ES6 ie ECMAScript,so it didn't understand jsx code.
So, PARCEL transpiled it before it reaches the JS.

PARCEL do it with the help of Babel.
Babel is a javascript compiler that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

We can write clss is jsx by -

React Components - 
1.Class Based(OLD Way)
2.Function Based (NEW Way)

Funtional Component - Always starts with Capital Letter and return a jsx 
Syntax =>
const HeadingComponent = () => {
    return <h1>Namaste from Funtional Component</h1>;
};

but we can write this as =>
const HeadingComponent = () => <h1>Namaste from Funtional Component</h1>;
 both works same.


We can write JS code under HTML like code in jsx using {} =>
<div id="container">
    <h2>{100+200}</h2>
</div>
