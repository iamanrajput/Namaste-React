# Chapter 03 - Laying the Foundation

## What is `JSX`?
- JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
- JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods.
- JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
- JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.
- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within their JavaScript files.

Many people say JSX is "HTML in JS," but that's not accurateâ€”JSX is a HTML-like syntax.

## Example Comparison

Earlier, people used to write React code like this:

```
const heading = React.createElement(
    "h1",
    {id: "heading"},
    "Namaste React ðŸš€"
);
```

 But with JSX syntax, it looks like this:
```
const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">Namaste React using JSXðŸš€</h1>;
```
Both versions work the same way, so people prefer JSX.

## How JSX Works with JavaScript Engines

JavaScript engines understand ES6 (i.e., ECMAScript), so they don't natively understand JSX code. That's where PARCEL comes inâ€”it transpiles JSX code before it reaches the JavaScript engine.

PARCEL does this with the help of Babel. Babel is a JavaScript compiler that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards-compatible version of JavaScript that works in current and older browsers or environments.

We can write clss is jsx by -
that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.


## React Components - 
1. Class Based(OLD Way)
2. Function Based (NEW Way)

### Funtional Component - Always starts with Capital Letter and return a jsx 
```
const HeadingComponent = () => {
    return <h1>Namaste from Funtional Component</h1>;
};
```
but we can write this as 
```
const HeadingComponent = () => <h1>Namaste from Funtional Component</h1>;
```
both works same.


### We can write JS code under HTML like code in jsx using {} =>
```
<div id="container">
    <h2>{100+200}</h2>
</div>
```
